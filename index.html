          Hello! My name is Ella. I'm currently a rising senior at Madison
          Central High School which is located in Richmond, Kentucky. During my
          free time, I like to play volleyball and read. My favorite book series
          is Percy Jackson. I'm also in the marching band of my school and play
          the alto saxophone. The love of my life is my German Shepard dog Reba.
          Although, I love my calico cat Tootsie too. My favorite school
          subjects are math and science, so I have been interested in computer
          science. However, I have no experience as a computer scientist and my
          school doesn't offer many opportunities, so I'm glad to be able to
          particpate in this Summer Immersion Program and learn how to code :)
